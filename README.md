# Exploring GAN Variants for Balancing Imbalanced Datasets

a comparative analysis of evaluating the impact of imbalance data on model perfor-
mance. Additional, different Generative Adversarial Networks architecture were investigated for
augmentation, including Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Conditional GAN (CGAN), and
Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)

Notebooks:
- Vanilla GAN
- CGAN
- WGAN
