# Exploring-GAN-Variants-for-Balancing-Imbalanced-Datasets
A comparative analysis of evaluating the impact of imbalance data on model performance. Additional, different Generative Adversarial Networks architecture were investigated for augmentation, including Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Conditional GAN (CGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
